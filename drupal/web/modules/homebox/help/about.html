<p>The <strong>Homebox</strong> module allows site administrators
    to create dashboards for their users, using blocks as widgets.
    Blocks in a Homebox page are reorderable by dragging.</p>

<p>Homebox is currently used on Drupal.org for the 'Your Dashboard' feature.</p>

<p>Version of Homebox is under active development for Drupal 8.</p>

<p>The core homebox module should be more or less alpha-ready.
    Please help test and fix this portion, so we can release 8.x-beta!</p>
